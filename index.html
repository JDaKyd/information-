  <p>A polar bear's hair is not white it's colorless Its strands are thick, hollow, and reflect light. This is what makes them appear white. Polar bears actually have black skin underneath that thick coat of fur, which helps them soak up the sun's warm rays in the chilly Arctic.</p>

  <p>Largest of the flamingos, the American Flamingo is the only species of flamingo with any dimorphism. Though there is no difference in color or plumage, the males are significantly taller than the females. There is no real difference between the sexes in other species. They have large, rounded bodies balanced on very straight and very long legs (although the thigh itself is only 3 inches long). The flamingoâ€™s beak, the feature most recognized, sets them apart. A unique shape, with a 45-degree angle in the middle, it facilitates the plumping filtration. The beaks of the chicks are straight.</p>

  <h1>facts about virues and diseases</h1>
  <P> Viruses evolve faster than any other living organism
    When one copy of the virus genome gets into a host cell, it multiplies incredibly quickly. Within hours, thousands of copies can be made from a single virus. Since viruses cycle through multiple generations so quickly, they end up making frequent mistakes when copying their genetic information.</P>
